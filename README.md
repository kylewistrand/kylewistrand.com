I wanted a place to showcase some of the work I have done, so I knew I needed to build myself a website.

Taking it one step further, I wanted to build a sort of template that anyone could use for their own online portfolio.

To achieve this, I built a small single-page webapp interface with ReactJS. All of the data for the portfolio is stored in a JSON file, which the app queries to populate the interface. This way, anyone can fork this repository and just edit their copy of the JSON file to add information about their portfolio, and they'll have a ready-to-publish website!

In the future I'd like to build a utility to generate the JSON file so that non-technical people can also use this format!
